### 爪哇 JDBC 简介

JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC API is a Java API which is used to access tabular data, especially which are stored in the relational database. JDBC works with Java on platforms like Windows, MacOS, and UNIX.

### 什么是 JDBC？

JDBC is used for connecting java programming language with databases. JDBC library has APIs for each task, which is mentioned below.

1.  创建到数据库的连接。
2.  为 SQL 或 MySQL 创建语句。
3.  在数据库中使用 SQL 或 MySQL 执行查询。
4.  查看和修改结果记录。

JDBC provides a complete set of an interface which allows access to the database. It can also be used by different types of executables, they are as follows:

1.  Java 应用程序
2.  java 小程序
3.  java servlet
4.  Java 服务器页面(JSP)
5.  企业 JavaBean s(EJB)。

All these executables are able to use a JDBC driver to access a database. The java.sql package contains classes and interfaces for JDBC API. Following is a list of some interfaces of JDBC API:

1.  驱动程序接口
2.  连接接口
3.  语句接口
4.  准备报表界面
5.  可调用语句接口
6.  结果集接口
7.  结果集元数据接口
8.  数据库元数据接口
9.  行集接口

Following is a list of some interfaces of JDBC API:

1.  DriverManager 类
2.  Blob 类
3.  公务级
4.  类型类

### JDBC 建筑

JDBC Architecture consists of two layers:

1.  **JDBC API:** 它提供应用程序到 JDBC 管理器的连接。
2.  **JDBC 驱动 API:** 它支持 JDBC 管理器到驱动程序的连接。

For transparent connectivity, JDBC API uses a driver manager and database-specific drivers. JDBC driver manager checks that the correct driver is used to access each data source. Driver manager can support multiple concurrent drivers which may be connected to multiple databases. ![Java Applications](../Images/77e13f72ccde76d1b03582ea21cd5586.png)

### JDBC 司机

JDBC drivers implement the defined interfaces in the JDBC API, for interacting with your database server. Java.sql package contains classes and their behaviors and their main implementation is done in third-party drivers. The Third-party vendor implements the *java.sql.Driver* interface in their database driver. **There are four types of drivers as following:** **Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver** In Type 1 driver, a JDBC bridge accesses ODBC driver which is installed on each client machine. Data Source Name (DSN) is to be configured on the client machine which represents the target database. This type of driver is only for experimental use. ![JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver](../Images/0b24a0ebcf6aeec2e7a7b6890e807239.png) **Type 2: JDBC-Native API** In Type 2 driver, JDBC API calls are converted into native C/C++ API calls, these calls are unique to the database. These types of drivers are provided by database vendors and it is used in the same manner as the JDBC-ODBC Bridge. This driver which is provided by vendors must be installed on each client machine. If the database is changed then the native API also must be changed, because native API is specific to the database. ![JDBC Native API](../Images/9da16fda97d6387080938b733e14fe36.png) **Type 3: JDBC-Net pure Java** In Type 3 driver, to access the database, a three-tier approach is used. Standard network sockets are used by JDBC clients to communicate with the middleware application server. These middleware application servers translate socket information into call format which is required by the DBMS and then forward it to the database server. As it does not requires any code installation on the client that is why this kind of drivers are extremely flexible. ![JDBC-Net pure Java](../Images/495f6aa2a1fb16cce4687295a35ef663.png) **Type 4: 100% Pure Java** In Type 4 driver, pure Java-based driver communicates with the vendor's database directly through a socket connection. Type 4 driver has the highest performance and it is provided by the vendor itself. It does not require special software on the client or server that is why it is extremely flexible and also these drivers can be downloaded dynamically. ![Pure Java-based driver communicates](../Images/9924b497760bff082a4cee526afaf432.png)

### Java 中 JDBC 的优势

1.  如果安装了正确的驱动程序，任何数据库都可以读取。
2.  从数据库自动创建数据的 XML 结构。
3.  不需要内容转换。
4.  支持查询和存储过程。
5.  可用于同步和异步处理。
6.  支持模块。

### Java 中 JDBC 的缺点

1.  需要为每种类型的数据库部署正确的驱动程序。
2.  不能用一个序列更新或插入多个表。
