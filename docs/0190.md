Arduino:  Arduino UNO is the popular open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use software and hardware. It is intended for artists, hobbyists, designers, and anyone interested in building interactive objects. It is designed to be as flexible as likely to meet the needs of your project.
It is based on the ATmega 328P that has 14 digital I/O pins and six analog inputs. It comes with 32-KB of Flash memory. It can accommodate code that deals with complicated logic and operations. The Arduino board needs an add-on board with Ethernet to communicate over the internet. The ethernet board is known as the Ethernet Shield. The device could be programmed in the Arduino IDE.

 Raspberry Pi: The Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized computer that connects to a monitor or televisions and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a small, capable     device that allows people to explore computing and learn to program. Raspberry Pi is usually programmed in Python language.
The recently launched Raspberry Pi 3 includes built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies that make it the most compact and autonomous computer. Based on the Broadcom BCM 2837 SoC with a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor and 1 GB of RAM, the Raspberry Pi is a powerful platform. In addition to the 10/100 Ethernet port, the Raspberry Pi 3 is fitted with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 802.11n and Bluetooth 4.1\. The HDMI port makes the connection of A/V sources even easier. 

NodeMCU: NodeMCU is an open-source LUA based firmware developed for ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. NodeMCU is similar to Arduino Hardware with an Input-Output ability built-in the board. It also has a built-in Wi-Fi to connect directly to the internet to control your things online. It greatly speeds up your internet of things application development process. It must be programmed with Arduino IDE and Lua.
 BeagleBone: BeagleBone is a single-board computer with a Linux-based operating system. It uses a more powerful ARM processor than Raspberry Pi.
BeagleBone Black is a low-cost, community-based development platform for hobbyists and developers. It starts Linux in shorter than 10 seconds and starts development in shorter than 5 minutes with a single USB cable.
You can write your code in any language such as C, C++, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, or even a shell script.

CC3200: The CC3200 host driver is designed to support integrated applications. It uses low-power, low-cost microcontrollers with compressed board space.
The CC3200 is a programmable Wi-Fi MCU that enables accurate integrated internet of things development. The CC3200 device has the same Wi-Fi Network Processor (NWP) sub-system as the CC3100 device. The NWP integrates all protocols for Wi-Fi and the Internet, much minimizing MCU software requirements. With built-in security protocols, Simple Link Wi-Fi provides a robust and simple security experience.
