XML 标签区分大小写。标签是 XML 中最重要的部分。XML 标签是标签的基础。它们可以用来插入注释，声明解析环境所需的设置，以及插入特殊指令。它被分类如下

### 开始标签

The starting of every non-empty XML element is marked by start-tag. **Example**

```
<Employee>
```

Here <Employee> is Starting tag of an element.

### 结束标签

Every element that has start tag should end with end-tag. **Example**

```
</Employee>
```

Here </Employee> is end tag of element and use slash ("/") before name of element.

### 空标签

The text that present in between start-tag and end-tag is called content. An element which have no content is called empty. It is represented by two ways:-

### 第一种方式

Start-tag immediately followed by end-tag: <tr></tr>

### 第二种方式

Complete empty-element tag: <hr/> Empty-element tags are used for any element which has no content.[← Prev](https://www.tutorialandexample.com/xml-comments)[Next →](https://www.tutorialandexample.com/xml-processing)
